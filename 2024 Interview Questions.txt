*****************************************
1.Rate your self in AWS out of 10? 
2. So in terms of EC2, what are the different classes of instances that you have launched? 
3. so let's say you have an instance that has a large that has a size of large. So how many V CPU and how much RAM can I expect out of that? So if a size of an instance is large. 
How much V CPU's size of the instance for you can assume like a C6A dot large 
4.Have you worked on Autoscaling Group? 
5. OK, so now let's say there is one application that is required to be set up. 
It is to be run on a EC2 instance and it has to be using an auto scaling group so that the application can scale up and down. 
So could you walk me through from step #1 all the way to the end as to what all work you will have to do to configure that application, deploy it on EC2 and make sure that it is running behind auto scaling group? 

6. After scaling of the application, now it is time to scale down the application or scale in the application. So is there any control that you can define that will tell you how your application will scale in? 
7.So now so have you worked on some of the container services we have like ECS or uh light sail or.? 
8. And do you know fundamentals on containers and Docker? 
9. Here and what are the infrastructure as code tool that you have experienced with? 
10.And do you have any knowledge or experience of cloud formation or Terraform? 
11. So we'll we'll start with Docker.We'll start with a few questions on Docker.So let's say you you have, you have to help out one of your colleague who is trying to build a Docker file by himself. 
12. And could you just walk me through what all goes in a Docker file based on your experience? 
13. So in terms of cloud formations, where are there any functions that you have worked with in built functions? 
14. OK, so let's uh, let's move on to some troubleshooting questions. There is an application that is running on EC2 instances.It is behind the same auto scaling group that you helped us create and it is connecting to RDS service OK and now you have some of your development teammates who, well, we'll call that their application is not working, OK. And they have asked for your help to understand what is the problem. OK, now could you describe to me step by step how will you approach this problem and how will you isolate either the problem or help in moving towards the you know the problem area? 
15. Look, you can assume that this application was working fine and application is on easy too and RDS. You can assume my SQL RDS running in multi AZ. And they're running within the same VPC the so as per the developers, they are not able to open their application page. 
16.So now let's assume that the networking is fine and DNS is fine because the application was wondering working up till 11:00 AM tomorrow today morning. OK, if you rule out the network and the DNS, what other part of your infrastructure you may like to check? 
17. What services are free in AWS (IAM)

GitHub
-------
1. What is cherry pick and explain a scenario where you used this.
2. I made a wrong commit and I want to undo the commit. Is there any command present and how you do.
3. Git revert can revert back last commit, what if I have a series of commits and I want revert all of them. Then what is your approach and how you will do or is there any possibility to perform this action.
4. Do you have idea about detached head in git.
5. What is your typical branching followed in your organization.
6. As per your branching strategy, you mentioned that all of your source code is finally merged to master in development env and from there you are moving to other stages like testing, staging and production. So you migrated the code till production and deployed the code into production, then you faced an issue in production. So in order to fix the issue I need to modify the code and then deploy again but can I rely on development env master branch code as source of truth? Interviewer said that I cannot rely as dev master contains additional code (new dev code + prod code) which is not exactly existing prod. So how will you deal such issue in this situation and steps to fix the issue.
7. I accidentally/intentionally deleted a branch from both local repo and remote repo or after merge was completed we deleted the branch. Is there any way to bring the deleted branch back. Have you experienced this and how you will do this.

5. How are you handling Build issues in jenkins. How you troubleshoot and fix them, explain with some scenarios.
6. In your experience have you ever faced a situation where your jenkins jobs are running very slow and jenkins server is taking long time to respond and some times it says timeout. What is that root cause you found for such type of performance related issues and how you fixed that issue.
7. How are you managing jenkins server, so that it runs all the jobs smoothly without having performance issues and to reduce the load on server.

Interview Important Question for Kubernetes? 
What is difference between nodeSelector Vs nodeAffinity ??
NodeSelector is a basic and straightforward mechanism in Kubernetes that allows us to control which nodes a Pod can be scheduled on by specifying key-value pairs that must match labels on the desired nodes. 
while Node Affinity allows us to specify rules that determine which nodes a pod can be scheduled on based on nodes specific labels.
